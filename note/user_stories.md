# User Stories

## The App/Entry
Who are we designing this app for? What is the key concept that we would use to advertise our app?

### The who
- Generally geared towards people who want help managing their traits, though can still be useful for others as far as task management with some fun extras

### The what
- We want to draw people in by advertising it as entertaining, while also being simple to use given that more people of all ages are getting diagnosed these days. The other concept we want to highlight is also the task management aspect of it. At it's core this is an app to help with productivity, that has entertainment bundled in.

 - What is a regular user's thought process going to be when they first open our app?
"I've come here to help get my tasks organised, but curious as to how they've geared this towards people with ADHD"

 - What is the user seeing?
"It's a nice, clean-looking app with a few key features to explore"
 - Point out the key features we want users to look at, don't clutter it.
 - A clear headline as to what it's for (grab the attention, get across the key information quickly)
 - Key features of the app, where do we want them to start? (To-Do List, Sign-Up/In, Stuff)
 - Footer ideas - links to additional information (explanations of our features, links to connected tech, hotline services)
 - If a user's signed in, keep a task input somewhere on all pages so that whenever a task comes to mind, they can add it in quickly.

## To-Do List
### Why is the user here?
"I want to get started on some tasks but I want to get started quickly, I don't want to waste time on interruptions or roadblocks"

### What do we want them to see?
"It's nice and neat, teaches me how to make a list as I go, and offers some praise at certain steps in the process"
 - Give them the minimum they need to get started, then we can give more information on the way so that they aren't overwhelmed from the get go
 - We still want to keep the simple layout
 - Start with a task, to build the list. Don't start with the list
 - Don't offer too much at once, but give them the opportunity to look at the whole process if they want to
 - Once they have a basic list together, then offer them the choice to create an account if they want to save the list and come back to it

## User Interface concepts
Minimalist, but interesting UI
 - A simple color scheme to keep attention without being too distracting
 - Find a way to draw attention to menu items
 - Call To Action ('Get started!', 'Start here!')
 - Implement animations to give a simple menu some surprises (extension)

Highlighting Progression ('You have x/y tasks completed, keep it up!')

Creating Individual lists and track their progress independently
 - Epic (Presentation Day)
 - Features (User Stories)
